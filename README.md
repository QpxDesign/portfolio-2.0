# quinnpatwardhan.com - my open-source portfolio website
This project was created by Quinn Patwardhan, in React Native with Typescript. All code was 100% written by me and me alone, and the design (except for the mesh gradient), is entirely original. All photos and graphic designs are copyright of me, and cannot be used without my express permission. All code can be used with proper accreditation, although no support will be provided. The backend will not be open-sourced for rather obvious security reasons, although I can say it was written using MySQL, Node, and Express.js. All passwords are tokenized and not stored in plaintext, and I have made every effort to prevent the leakage of personal information. The only data stored is your username and your tokenized password (as well as any comments you make).
